# Deep Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

The repository contains a PyTorch reproduction of the TM-CTC model from the [Deep Audio-Visual Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02108) paper. We train three models - Audio-Only (AO), Video-Only (VO) and Audio-Visual (AV), on the [LRS2 dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html) for the speech-to-text transcription task.

System packages:

	ffmpeg==2.8.15
	python==3.6.9

Python packages:

	editdistance==0.5.3
	matplotlib==3.1.1
	numpy==1.18.1
	opencv-python==4.2.0
	pytorch==1.2.0
	scipy==1.3.1
	tqdm==4.42.1

CUDA 10.0 (if NVIDIA GPU is to be used):

## Project Structure

The structure of the `audio_only`, `video_only` and `audio_visual` directories is as follows:

#### Directories

`/checkpoints`: Temporary directory to store intermediate model weights and plots while training. Gets automatically created.

`/data`: Directory containing the LRS2 Main and Pretrain dataset class definitions and other required data-related utility functions.

`/final`: Directory to store the final trained model weights and plots. If available, place the pre-trained model weights in the `models` subdirectory.

`/models`: Directory containing the class definitions for the models.

`/utils`: Directory containing function definitions for calculating CER/WER, greedy search/beam search decoders and preprocessing of data samples. Also contains functions to train and evaluate the model.

#### Files

`checker.py`: File containing checker/debug functions for testing all the modules and the functions in the project as well as any other checks to be performed.

`config.py`: File to set the configuration options and hyperparameter values.

`demo.py`: Python script for generating predictions with the specified trained model for all the data samples in the specified demo directory.

`preprocess.py`: Python script for preprocessing all the data samples in the dataset.

`pretrain.py`: Python script for pretraining the model on the pretrain set of the LRS2 dataset using curriculum learning.

`test.py`: Python script to test the trained model on the test set of the LRS2 dataset.

`train.py`: Python script to train the model on the train set of the LRS2 dataset.


## Results

We provide Word Error Rate (WER) achieved by the models on the test set of the LRS2 dataset with both Greedy Search and Beam Search (with Language Model) decoding techniques. We have tested in cases of clean audio and noisy audio (0 dB SNR). We also give WER in cases where only one of the modalities is used in the Audio-Visual model.

## Pre-trained Weights

Download the pre-trained weights for the Visual Frontend from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgpu3X6WFbkrMDaHGX-8SWzj4gS-lU6s/view?usp=drivesdk) and for the Language Model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19viuy3ZXDkmigzdEiRGSZZG1TXwqw3Tb/view?usp=drivesdk). Once the Visual Frontend and Language Model weights are downloaded, place them in a folder and add their paths in the `config.py` file.

For the pre-trained weights of the AO, VO and AV models, please send an email at `smeet.shah.c2020<AT>iitbombay.org` from your institutional email ID. Place the weights of each model in the corresponding `/final/models` directory.

***Note:***
- *Replace `<AT>` with `@` in the email ID while sending an email. It may take few days to reply back. Please have patience.*
- *Do NOT open issues on GitHub requesting pre-trained weights. Such issues may be deleted. I am sharing weights only via replies to email requests from valid institutional email IDs.*
- *The link for these weights has also been updated. If required, please resend an email for new link.*


## How To Use

If planning to train the models, download the complete LRS2 dataset from [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html) or in cases of custom datasets, have the specifications and folder structure similar to LRS2 dataset.

Steps have been provided to either train the models or to use the trained models directly for inference:

#### Training

Set the configuration options in the `config.py` file before each of the following steps as required. Comments have been provided for each option. Also, check the Training Details section below as a guide for training the models from scratch.

1. Run the `preprocess.py` script to preprocess and generate the required files for each sample.

2. Run the `pretrain.py` script for one iteration of curriculum learning. Run it multiple times, each time changing the `PRETRAIN_NUM_WORDS` argument in the `config.py` file to perform multiple iterations of curriculum learning.

3. Run the `train.py` script to finally train the model on the train set.

4. Once the model is trained, run the `test.py` script to obtain the performance of the trained model on the test set.

5. Run the `demo.py` script to use the model to make predictions for each sample in a demo directory. Read the specifications for the sample in the `demo.py` file.

#### Inference

1. Set the configuration options in the `config.py` file. Comments have been provided for each option.

2. Run the `demo.py` script to use the model to make predictions for each sample in a demo directory. Read the specifications for the sample in the `demo.py` file.


## Important Training Details

- We perform iterations of Curriculum Learning by changing the `PRETRAIN_NUM_WORDS` config option. The number of words used in each iteration of curriculum learning is as follows: 1,2,3,5,7,9,13,17,21,29,37, i.e., 11 iterations in total.

- During Curriculum Learning, the minibatch size (default=32) is reduced by half each time we hit an Out Of Memory error.

- In each iteration, the training is terminated forcefully once the validation set WER flattens. We also make sure that the Learning Rate has decreased to the minimum value before terminating the training.

- We train the AO and VO models first. We then initialize the AV model with weights from the trained AO and VO models as follows: AO Audio Encoder &#8594; AV Audio Encoder, VO Video Encoder &#8594; AV Video Encoder, VO Video Decoder &#8594; AV Joint Decoder.

- The weights of the Audio and Video Encoders are fixed during AV model pretraining. The complete AV model is trained on the train set after the pretraining is complete.

- We have used a GPU with 11 GB memory for our training. Each model took around 7 days for complete training.
