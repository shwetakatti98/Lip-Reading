# Project Description
The project focuses on lip reading and maximizing efficiency of detection on existing video datasets. The problem statement can be found on

# Code Base
All code changes can be found along the path https://github.com/shwetakatti98/Lip-Reading
# Literature Survey and Previous Work
Out of the 25 papers studied, we will first start off with the implementation of these methodologies to begin with the comparitive analysis of the best architecture

# Work Done
1. Literature survey was completed for around 25 papers. Primary architectures that can be chosen for the detection were shortlisted. Also publicly available datasets
 for the same were chosen.
